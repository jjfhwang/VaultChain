# VaultChain

## Description

VaultChain is a TypeScript library designed to provide a secure and auditable system for managing sensitive data. It leverages cryptographic techniques and a blockchain-inspired data structure to ensure data integrity, prevent unauthorized access, and maintain a transparent history of modifications. This makes it suitable for applications requiring high levels of security, compliance, and accountability, such as financial systems, healthcare records, and supply chain management. VaultChain aims to simplify the implementation of secure data management practices by offering a robust and easy-to-use API. It focuses on creating a verifiable chain of data entries, where each entry's integrity depends on the previous one, making tampering easily detectable.

## Features

*   **Data Encryption:** VaultChain employs robust encryption algorithms to protect sensitive data at rest. Data is encrypted before being added to the chain, ensuring confidentiality even if the underlying storage is compromised.
*   **Immutable Data Chain:** The core of VaultChain is an immutable chain of data entries. Each entry contains a cryptographic hash of the previous entry, creating a strong link between them. This ensures that any attempt to modify an entry will invalidate subsequent entries, making tampering evident.
*   **Auditable History:** VaultChain maintains a complete and auditable history of all data modifications. Each entry includes a timestamp and metadata about the changes, allowing for easy tracking and auditing of data access and modifications.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** VaultChain supports Role-Based Access Control, allowing you to define granular permissions for different users or roles. This ensures that only authorized personnel can access or modify specific data entries.
*   **Key Management:** VaultChain provides a secure key management system for handling encryption keys. This includes features such as key rotation, key storage, and key access control, ensuring that keys are protected from unauthorized access.

## Installation

To install VaultChain, you'll need Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd VaultChain
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This command will install all the necessary dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

3.  **Build the project (optional):**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This command will compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript, creating a `dist` directory with the compiled files. While not strictly required for immediate usage (especially with tools like `ts-node`), building is recommended for production deployments.

## Usage

Here are some code examples demonstrating how to use VaultChain:

```typescript
import { VaultChain } from './src/VaultChain'; // Adjust path if needed
import { DataEntry } from './src/DataEntry'; // Adjust path if needed

// Initialize VaultChain with a unique identifier
const vaultChain = new VaultChain("my-data-vault");

// Create a new data entry
const data = {
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 30,
    sensitive_info: "This is confidential."
};

const entry = new DataEntry(data);

// Add the data entry to the chain
vaultChain.addEntry(entry);

// Retrieve the latest entry
const latestEntry = vaultChain.getLatestEntry();

if (latestEntry) {
    console.log("Latest Entry:", latestEntry.data);
} else {
    console.log("No entries found in the chain.");
}

// Example: Adding another entry
const anotherData = {
    product_id: "12345",
    price: 99.99,
    quantity: 10
};

const anotherEntry = new DataEntry(anotherData);
vaultChain.addEntry(anotherEntry);

const secondLatestEntry = vaultChain.getLatestEntry();

if (secondLatestEntry) {
    console.log("Second Latest Entry:", secondLatestEntry.data);
} else {
    console.log("No entries found in the chain.");
}

// Example: Verifying the chain's integrity
const isValid = vaultChain.verifyChain();
console.log("Is the chain valid?", isValid);

// Example: Accessing specific entry by index
const firstEntry = vaultChain.getEntry(0);
if (firstEntry) {
    console.log("First Entry:", firstEntry.data);
} else {
    console.log("No entry found at index 0.");
}
```

**Explanation:**

*   **`import { VaultChain } from './src/VaultChain';`**:  Imports the `VaultChain` class from its module. Adjust the path to reflect your project's structure.
*   **`const vaultChain = new VaultChain("my-data-vault");`**: Creates a new `VaultChain` instance, providing a unique identifier.
*   **`const entry = new DataEntry(data);`**: Creates a new `DataEntry` instance with the data you want to store.
*   **`vaultChain.addEntry(entry);`**: Adds the data entry to the VaultChain.  This encrypts the data and calculates the necessary hashes.
*   **`vaultChain.getLatestEntry();`**: Retrieves the most recently added entry from the chain.
*   **`vaultChain.verifyChain();`**: Verifies the integrity of the entire chain by checking the consistency of the cryptographic hashes.
*   **`vaultChain.getEntry(0);`**: Retrieves the entry at the specified index.

**Note:**

*   The provided code assumes you have a `DataEntry` class defined in `src/DataEntry.ts`.  You might need to adjust the import paths accordingly.
*   Error handling (e.g., handling exceptions during encryption or verification) is omitted for brevity but should be included in production code.
*   Consider implementing more sophisticated key management and access control mechanisms for enhanced security.
