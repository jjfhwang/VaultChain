# VaultChain

## Description

VaultChain is a TypeScript-based repository dedicated to cryptography research, implementations, and tooling. Its primary purpose is to provide a platform for exploring and developing robust cryptographic solutions. We aim to create a collection of reusable components and utilities that can be leveraged for various security-sensitive applications. The value of VaultChain lies in its commitment to security best practices, clean code, and comprehensive documentation, making it a valuable resource for both researchers and developers. We strive to stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in cryptography and provide practical, well-tested implementations.

## Features

*   **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Implementation:** A highly optimized and secure implementation of the AES encryption algorithm, supporting various key sizes (128, 192, 256 bits) and modes of operation (e.g., CBC, CTR, GCM).  Includes padding schemes and error handling.
*   **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) Support:**  Provides implementations of essential ECC algorithms, including ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) for digital signatures and ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) for key exchange.  Supports common curves like secp256k1 and Curve25519.
*   **Hashing Algorithms:**  Offers a selection of widely used cryptographic hash functions, such as SHA-256, SHA-512, and Blake2b, for data integrity and secure storage of passwords. Includes support for salting and key derivation functions.
*   **Random Number Generation:** Provides a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG) based on the Web Crypto API or Node.js crypto module, essential for generating secure keys and initialization vectors.
*   **Base64 Encoding/Decoding:** Utilities for encoding and decoding data using Base64, a common encoding scheme used for transmitting binary data over text-based protocols. Includes URL-safe Base64 variants.

## Installation

To install VaultChain and its dependencies, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/VaultChain.git
    cd VaultChain
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies using npm or yarn:**

    ```bash
    npm install  # Or yarn install
    ```

3.  **TypeScript compilation:**

    ```bash
    npm run build # Or yarn build
    ```

    This command will compile the TypeScript code into JavaScript files in the `dist` directory.

## Usage

Here are some examples demonstrating how to use the components of VaultChain:

**1. AES Encryption:**

```typescript
import { AES } from './src/aes'; // Assuming AES implementation is in src/aes.ts

async function encryptAndDecrypt() {
  const key = await AES.generateKey(256); // Generate a 256-bit key
  const plaintext = "This is a secret message.";
  const iv = await AES.generateIV(); // Generate a random initialization vector

  const ciphertext = await AES.encrypt(plaintext, key, iv, 'aes-gcm'); // Use AES-GCM mode
  console.log("Ciphertext:", ciphertext);

  const decryptedText = await AES.decrypt(ciphertext, key, iv, 'aes-gcm');
  console.log("Decrypted Text:", decryptedText);

  if (plaintext === decryptedText) {
    console.log("AES encryption and decryption successful!");
  } else {
    console.error("AES encryption and decryption failed!");
  }
}

encryptAndDecrypt();
```

**2. SHA-256 Hashing:**

```typescript
import { SHA256 } from './src/sha256'; // Assuming SHA256 implementation is in src/sha256.ts

async function hashData() {
  const data = "This is the data to be hashed.";
  const hash = await SHA256.hash(data);
  console.log("SHA-256 Hash:", hash);
}

hashData();
```

**3. ECDSA Signature Generation and Verification:**

```typescript
import { ECDSA } from './src/ecdsa'; // Assuming ECDSA implementation is in src/ecdsa.ts

async function generateAndVerifySignature() {
    const keyPair = await ECDSA.generateKeyPair('secp256k1'); // Generate an ECDSA key pair using secp256k1
    const message = "Sign this message!";
    const signature = await ECDSA.sign(message, keyPair.privateKey);
    console.log("Signature:", signature);

    const isValid = await ECDSA.verify(message, signature, keyPair.publicKey);
    console.log("Signature is valid:", isValid);
}

generateAndVerifySignature();
```

**Note:**  These examples assume that you have structured your TypeScript files within the `src` directory. Adjust the import paths accordingly based on your project structure.  You also might need to adjust the function calls depending on the exact API exposed by your modules. These are meant to illustrate the general usage pattern.
